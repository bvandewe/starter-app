# Running the Application

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the application using Docker Compose.

## Running with Docker

The `Makefile` provides several commands to manage the application services.

- **Start all services**:

    ```bash
    make up
    ```

    This will start the application, database, and other services in the background.

- **View service URLs**:

    ```bash
    make urls
    ```

    This command displays the URLs for the running services, including the main application, API docs, and Keycloak.

- **View logs**:

    ```bash
    make logs-app
    ```

    This will show the logs for the main application service.

- **Stop all services**:

    ```bash
    make down
    ```

    This will stop and remove all running containers.
